# Ola_App
**Application Overview**

**Starting the App:**

When you run the application, a window opens with two buttons: "Register" and "Login".

**Registering a New User:**

- If you are a new user, you can click on the "Register" button. A new window opens where you can enter your username, email address, and password.
Important: Each email address can only be used once. If you try to register with an email that is already in use, the app will show an error message, and you won’t be able to register.
- Once you fill in your details and click the "Register" button, your information is saved to the system (the database), and a message will pop up saying "User Registered Successfully!"

**Logging In:**

- If you already have an account, you can click the "Login" button. A new window will appear asking for your username or email and password.
- After entering the correct details, you’ll be logged in and taken to the next window to book a ride.

**Booking a Ride:**

- Once you log in successfully, the app will ask for your pickup location and dropoff location.
- After entering both locations and clicking the "Confirm Ride" button, the ride is booked, and a confirmation message pops up with your ride details.

**Summary:**

- First, register if you don’t have an account (with a unique email).
- Then, login to book a ride by entering your pickup and dropoff locations.
